# Introduction 

The Government's Indices of Deprivation 2015 uses a wide range of indicators to produce nationally consistent measures of deprivation across seven domains or themes. The indices have changed considerably since the first Index of Multiple Deprivation in 2000. Deprivation covers a broad range of issues and refers to unmet needs caused by a lack of resources of all kinds, not just financial. It includes measures such as low income, worklessness, poor qualifications, disability, crime, housing affordability and air quality.

We can now compare between 2004, 2007, 2010 and 2015. These statistics are a measure of deprivation, not affluence, and to recognise that not every person in a highly deprived area will themselves be deprived. Equally, there will be some deprived people living in the least deprived areas.

This analysis:

1. Scrape the data (where available) from [data.gov.uk](https://data.gov.uk/)
2. Subset the data based on Lower Super Output Areas that intersect the Peak District National Park
3. Map the latest data using [Leaflet for R](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) and data from the [Office for National Statistics Open Geography Portal](http://opengeography.ons.opendata.arcgis.com/) ESRI Arc GIS 

Super Output Areas are a geographic hierarchy designed to improve the reporting of small area statistics. The 34,753 LSOAs in England (32,844) and Wales (1,909) were built from groups of output areas that were created in 2003 and maintained in 2011. They have a minimum of 1,000 residents.

# Data Munging

## 1. Load the data

2004 Data is not available in the correct format online, so a prepared .csv is loaded in to the working directory

{% highlight r %}
## Import the English Indices of Deprivation 2004 - LSOA Level
IMD04 <- read.csv("/home/rstudio/Dropbox/PDNP/Maps/IMD/IMD DATA 2004/IMD2004.csv")
## Import the English Indices of Deprivation 2007 - LSOA Level
IMD07 <- read.csv(url("http://opendatacommunities.org/data/imd-rank-2007/cube/observations.csv?rows_dimension=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.org%2Flinked-data%2Fsdmx%2F2009%2Fdimension%23refArea&columns_dimension=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.org%2Flinked-data%2Fsdmx%2F2009%2Fdimension%23refPeriod&measure_property=http%3A%2F%2Fopendatacommunities.org%2Fdef%2FIMD%23IMD-rank"))
## Import the English Indices of Deprivation 2010 - LSOA Level
IMD10 <- read.csv(url("https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/15240/1871702.csv"))
## Import the English Indices of Deprivation 2015 - LSOA Level
IMD15 <- read.csv(url("https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/467774/File_7_ID_2015_All_ranks__deciles_and_scores_for_the_Indices_of_Deprivation__and_population_denominators.csv"))
{% endhighlight %}

## Tidy the data

{% highlight r %}
## Format the column names 2004
names(IMD04) [2] <- "Rank of Index of Multiple Deprivation Score"
names(IMD04) [3] <- "% Most Deprived"
## Format the column names 2007 
names(IMD07) [1] <- "Reference Area"
names(IMD07) [2] <- "Rank"
## Format the column names 2010
names(IMD10) [1] <- "LSOA CODE"
names(IMD10) [2] <- "PRE 2009 LA CODE"
names(IMD10) [3] <- "PRE 2009 LA NAME"
names(IMD10) [4] <- "POST 2009 LA CODE"
names(IMD10) [5] <- "POST 2009 LA NAME"
names(IMD10) [6] <- "GOR CODE"
names(IMD10) [7] <- "GOR NAME"
names(IMD10) [8] <- "IMD SCORE"
names(IMD10) [9] <- "RANK OF IMD SCORE (where 1 is most deprived)"
## Format the column names 2015
names(IMD15) [1] <- "LSOA code (2011)"
names(IMD15) [2] <- "LSOA name"
names(IMD15) [3] <- "Local Authority District code (2013)"
names(IMD15) [4] <- "Local Authority District name (2013)"
names(IMD15) [5] <- "IMD Score"
names(IMD15) [6] <- "IMD Rank (where 1 is most deprived)"
names(IMD15) [7] <- "IMD Decile"
{% endhighlight %}

Subset the data columns

{% highlight r %}
## Convert column to numeric 2007
IMD07$Rank <- as.numeric(as.character(IMD07$Rank))
## Subset the data columns 2010
IMD10 <- IMD10[ , 1:9]
## Subset the data columns 2015
IMD15 <- IMD15[ , 
{% endhighlight %}

# 2. Subset the LSOA Codes

We need to subset the data by geography. For this we use a list of LSOA where the population is greater than 50% in the Peak District National Park Boundary. 2004 has already been processed before it was imported. For this we use a pre determined list of LSOA codes to subset the information required. Below is a subset of LSOA codes where they intersect the Peak District National Park Boundary. *Further projects could include the weighted polygons to query the data by LSOA = > 50% population*.

**2007** Full LSOA name is only availble in 2007 data

{% highlight r %}
## Create a character vector of LSOA Codes
LSOAName <- c("High Peak 007C", "High Peak 007A", "High Peak 007B", "Derbyshire Dales 001A", "Derbyshire Dales 001B", "Derbyshire Dales 001C", "Derbyshire Dales 001D", "Derbyshire Dales 002A", "Derbyshire Dales 002B", "Derbyshire Dales 002C", "Derbyshire Dales 002D", "Derbyshire Dales 003A", "Derbyshire Dales 003B", "Derbyshire Dales 003C", "Derbyshire Dales 003D", "Derbyshire Dales 006F", "Derbyshire Dales 008C", "Staffordshire Moorlands 001A", "Staffordshire Moorlands 007A", "Staffordshire Moorlands 007C")

## Subest the data based on that vector
IMD07 <- IMD07[IMD07[['Reference Area']] %in% LSOAName, ]
{% endhighlight %}

For the 2010 and 2015 data we use the LSOA Code column

{% highlight r %}
## Create a character vector of LSOA Codes
LSOA_PDNP <- c("E01005409", "E01005410", "E01007426", "E01007926", "E01007956", "E01008128", "E01008129", "E01008147", "E01008158", "E01011075", "E01011168", "E01011174", "E01011177", "E01011182", "E01018586", "E01018591", "E01018669", "E01018670", "E01019599", "E01019600", "E01019601", "E01019602", "E01019604", "E01019605", "E01019606", "E01019611", "E01019613", "E01019614", "E01019615", "E01019617", "E01019618", "E01019620", "E01019630", "E01019631", "E01019632", "E01019712", "E01019713", "E01019714", "E01019718", "E01019725", "E01019734", "E01019735", "E01019736", "E01019737", "E01019741", "E01019742", "E01019744", "E01019754", "E01019755", "E01019763", "E01019764", "E01019770", "E01019771", "E01029467", "E01029797", "E01029801", "E01029817")
{% endhighlight %}

**2010 and 2015** Subset the data

{% highlight r %}
## Subest the data based on that vector
IMD10 <- IMD10[IMD10[['LSOA CODE']] %in% LSOA_PDNP, ]
IMD15 <- IMD15[IMD15[['LSOA code (2011)']] %in% LSOA_PDN
{% endhighlight %}

# Results

There are 32,482 LSOA in Engalnd and Wales. Averaging the IMD score and dividing by the total number of areas provided us with an average rank for the area. 

{% highlight r %}
## Average Rank of the data
AverageRank15 <- (mean(IMD15$`IMD Rank (where 1 is most deprived)`)/32482)*100
AverageRank10 <- (mean(IMD10$`RANK OF IMD SCORE (where 1 is most deprived)`)/32482)*100
AverageRank07 <- (mean(IMD07$Rank)/32482)*100
AverageRank04 <- (mean(IMD04$`Rank of Index of Multiple Deprivation Score`)/32482)*100
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight r %}
Year <- c("Average Rank 2004", "Average Rank 2007", "Average Rank 2010", "Average Rank 2015")
Percent_Most_Deprived <- c(AverageRank04, AverageRank07, AverageRank10, AverageRank15)
AverageRank <- data.frame(Year, Percent_Most_Deprived)
knitr::kable(AverageRank)
{% endhighlight %}

Over the last 11 years deprivation in the Peak District has remained relatively low compared with the surrounding Urban areas. 

# 3. Map the 2015 Data

To do this we will use the [leaflet for R](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) package. The spatial data is from the new beta site from the [Office for National Statistics Open Geography Portal](http://opengeography.ons.opendata.arcgis.com/) ESRI Arc GIS 

{% highlight r %}
## Load the packages
library(leaflet)
library(rgdal)
{% endhighlight %}

We could just add the .GEOjson as a layer using the '<addTopoJSON()>' function but we need to convert to a spatial class to facilitate the join with the IMD data frame we created earlier. 

{% highlight r %}
## Convert the data to SP class
url <- "http://opengeography.ons.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/cfe467b5bc804694a72428fe08b3ace2_0.geojson"
downloader::download(url = url, destfile = "/tmp/LSOA.GeoJSON")
LSOA <- readOGR(dsn = "/tmp/LSOA.GeoJSON", layer = "OGRGeoJSON")
{% endhighlight %}

Subset the .GEOjson file with the LSOA codes for the Peak District

{% highlight r %}
PDNP_LSOA <- subset(LSOA, LSOA$LSOA11CD %in% LSOA_PDNP)
{% endhighlight %}

Merge the spatial layer with the data frame to display the spatial layer

{% highlight r %}
## Merge data frame with spatial polygons layer
IMD_PDNP_LSOA <- sp::merge(PDNP_LSOA, IMD15, by.x="LSOA11CD", by.y="LSOA code (2011)")
{% endhighlight %}

Set the column data to numeric to be used for analysis

{% highlight r %}
## Set the data to numeric
IMD_PDNP_LSOA$'IMD Decile' <- as.numeric(IMD_PDNP_LSOA$'IMD Decile')
{% endhighlight %}

Set the colour bin for the thematic choropleth map. As this is based on the decile score we don't need to create any natural breaks in the data, this is done for us. 

{% highlight r %}
## Create the color bin
pal <- colorBin("YlOrRd", domain = IMD_PDNP_LSOA$'IMD Decile', n=10)
{% endhighlight %}

Create a label popup when the polygon is selected. This will display some key information about that area.

{% highlight r %}
## Create a Popup
LSOA_popup <- paste0("<strong>LSOA: </strong>",
                     IMD_PDNP_LSOA$'LSOA name',
                     "<br><strong>IMD Score: </strong>",
                     IMD_PDNP_LSOA$'IMD Score',
                     "<br><strong>IMD Rank (where 1 is most deprived): </strong>",
                     IMD_PDNP_LSOA$'IMD Rank (where 1 is most deprived)',
                     "<br><strong>IMD Decile (% Most Deprived): </strong>",
                     IMD_PDNP_LSOA$'IMD Decile')
{% endhighlight %}

## Now we Map the data :)

As you can see, 7 lines of R code has created a pretty nice map!

{% highlight r %}
## Map the data
leaflet(IMD_PDNP_LSOA) %>%
    setView(lng = -1.7, lat = 53.33, zoom = 9) %>% addTiles() %>%
    addPolygons(stroke = FALSE, fillOpacity = 0.7, smoothFactor = 0.5, 
                fillColor = ~pal(IMD_PDNP_LSOA$'IMD Decile'), popup = LSOA_popup) %>%
    addLegend("bottomright", pal = pal, values = ~'IMD Decile',
               title = "Decile (10=Least Deprived)",
              opacity = 1)
{% endhighlight %}
