Motion Intelligence helps business and public organizations harvest the power of advanced spatial analysis. This can be useful in Spatial Planning and business planning.

As yet, Route 360 and Network Analysis in ESRI only accepts points as sources, as ploygons would be useful for large destinations such as National Parks. I plan to overlay the Park Boundary with the road network and create ‘intersect points’ to use as a measure of ‘travel time to entrance’ coupled with the following point sources;

-PDNPA Cycle Hire Centres
-PDNPA Tourist Information Centres
-PDNPA Car Park Locations
