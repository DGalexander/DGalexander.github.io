## How many people live within 1 hours drive of the Peak District? 

Motion Intelligence helps business and public organizations harvest the power of advanced spatial analysis. This can be useful in Spatial Planning and business planning.

As yet, Route 360 and Network Analysis in ESRI only accepts points as sources, as ploygons would be useful for large destinations such as National Parks. I plan to overlay the Park Boundary with the road network and create ‘intersect points’ to use as a measure of ‘travel time to entrance’ coupled with the following point sources;

* PDNPA Cycle Hire Centres
* PDNPA Tourist Information Centres
* PDNPA Car Park Locations

# Analysis Steps
Catchment definition is an important part of site location and marketing decision-making and allows analysts to establish a relationship between supply and demand. A catchment can be defined, in this case, as the area from which visitors using Peak District National Park area are drawn.

What is the purpose of this catchment area analysis?

* Guide the Peak District National Park Authroity in the selection of particular geographic sectors on which to focus special marketing activity

In this example we create a Nominal Catchment. These can be misleading, as they are based on a radial distance from a defined point. We attempt to mitigate this by;

* creating a series of access points (A roads to the CLP area)
* using motion intelligence to accurately portray drive time
