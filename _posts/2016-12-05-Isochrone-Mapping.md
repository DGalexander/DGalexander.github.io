**Creating an Isochrone Map Using Java Script Route360**
========================

[Route 360](https://www.route360.net/index.html) is a modern open-source JavaScript library designed for mobile-friendly interactive maps which supports both Google and Leaflet maps. The API is free to access (5000 requests per month) and fork on git hub. 

Motion Intelligence helps business and public organizations harvest the power of advanced spatial analysis. This can be useful in Spatial Planning and business planning. 

As yet, only [Route 360](https://www.route360.net/index.html) only accepts points as sources, as ploygons would be useful for large destinations such as National Parks. I plan to overlay the Park Boundary with the road network and create *'intersect points'* to use as a measure of *'travel time to entrance'*.  

Below, I have adapated a simple polygon map to with travel time and travel type options using Castleton Visitor Centre as an example. I have embeded my [CodePen](http://codepen.io/) and [Gist](https://gist.github.com/).
