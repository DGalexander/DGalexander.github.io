**Raspberry Pi Infrared Bird box**
========================

After having an old raspberry pi laying around since 2013, I finally decided to do something with it! After searching online for a neat little project I decided to create a pi bird box. This project is based on this guide by [Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/infrared-bird-box/). Although it is late in the year for any nesting birds, nestboxes are best put up early during the autumn. Many birds will enter nestboxes during the autumn and winter, looking for a suitable place to roost or perhaps to feed. 

The best place to situate my Nestbox will be on a North facing wall out of direct sunlight. However, to an inconvenient washing line, I will have to situate my nestbox somewhere less appropriate than a North facing wall but it is still out of direct sunlight at least. The height is about 1.5 meters, hopefully this will attract Blue, Great or Coal Tits. 


## Equipment

 - Raspberry Pi Model A+
 - USB Wifi Adapter for the Raspberry Pi
 - Raspberry Pi NOIR camera module
 - 220 Ohm 1% Resistors
 - 5mm Infrared IR LED Light Emitting Diode
 - Bird box [Gardman](http://www.diy.com/departments/gardman-brown-nest-box/189469_BQ.prd)

## Method


 1. Set up the Camera Board
 2. Wire up the Infra Red LED
 3. Adjust the camera sighted in the Birdbox
 4. Compile ffmpeg and stream to the internet
 5. Create a script with a `while` loop to constantly send out video
 6. Create an SSH Connection using [Screen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Screen) 
 6. Edit the `rc.local` script to run the Screen every time the Pi boots
